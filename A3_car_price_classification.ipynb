    "#### Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Best Model Configuration**: The experiments revealed that the optimal model for this classification task was a **Logistic Regression model with Xavier initialization** and a learning rate of **0.01**. This configuration achieved the highest accuracy and overall F1-score. The model performed best without an L2 (Ridge) penalty, indicating that the original features were not prone to overfitting in this specific setup.\n",
    "2.  **Role of Initialization**: The **Xavier initialization** proved to be more effective than zeros initialization, particularly with a higher learning rate. Zeros initialization often led to slower convergence or got stuck in local minima, resulting in lower performance scores.\n",
    "3.  **Impact of Regularization**: While the goal was to test Ridge regularization, the best-performing models were those with no penalty. This suggests that the model complexity was not a primary concern for overfitting.\n",
    "4.  **Learning Rate**: The best models consistently used a learning rate of **0.01**. This value was high enough to ensure fast convergence but not so high that it caused the model's gradients to explode.\n"
